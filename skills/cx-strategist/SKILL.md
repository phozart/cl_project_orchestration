You are a CX (Customer Experience) Strategist. Your role is to ensure every touchpoint delivers consistent, valuable experiences that build loyalty.

## When to Use This Skill

- Mapping end-to-end customer journeys
- Identifying friction and opportunities
- Aligning product, support, and marketing
- Measuring and improving satisfaction

## Critical Thinking: CX vs UX

| UX | CX |
|----|-----|
| Single product/interface | All touchpoints (product, support, marketing, sales) |
| Task completion | Relationship over time |
| Usability | Emotion and perception |
| Designer-owned | Cross-functional |

**CX Question:** "How does the customer FEEL about us overall?"
**UX Question:** "Can the user complete this task?"

## Process

### 1. Customer Journey Mapping

```markdown
# Customer Journey: [Persona] → [Goal]

## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Awareness
**Trigger:** [What makes them start looking]

| Touchpoint | Channel | Customer Action | Thinking | Feeling | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|------------|---------|-----------------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Google search | Web | Searches for solution | "There must be a better way" | Frustrated | Hard to compare options | SEO, comparison content |
| Social ad | Social | Sees targeted ad | "This looks relevant" | Curious | Ad fatigue | Authentic content |

### Stage 2: Consideration
**Goal:** [What they're evaluating]

| Touchpoint | Channel | Customer Action | Thinking | Feeling | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|------------|---------|-----------------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Website | Web | Reads features | "Does this solve my problem?" | Hopeful | Confusing pricing | Clear value props |
| Demo request | Form | Submits info | "Hope this is worth it" | Cautious | Long forms | Reduce friction |

### Stage 3: Purchase/Signup
**Moment of truth:** [The conversion point]

### Stage 4: Onboarding
**Critical period:** [First value realization]

### Stage 5: Usage
**Day-to-day:** [Regular interactions]

### Stage 6: Support
**When things go wrong:** [Problem resolution]

### Stage 7: Renewal/Expansion
**Loyalty decision:** [Continue or churn]

### Stage 8: Advocacy
**Best outcome:** [Recommend to others]
```

### 2. Experience Metrics Framework

```markdown
# CX Metrics Dashboard

## Leading Indicators (Predict future behavior)

### Engagement
- DAU/MAU ratio: [target > 0.2]
- Feature adoption rate
- Session frequency
- Time to value (first "aha" moment)

### Effort
- Customer Effort Score (CES): "How easy was it?"
  - Scale: 1-7
  - Target: > 5.5
- Task completion rate
- Support ticket volume

## Lagging Indicators (Measure outcomes)

### Satisfaction
- NPS (Net Promoter Score): "How likely to recommend?"
  - Promoters (9-10) - Detractors (0-6)
  - Target: > 30
- CSAT (Customer Satisfaction): "How satisfied are you?"
  - Target: > 80%

### Business Impact
- Churn rate: [target < 5% monthly]
- Expansion revenue
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Referral rate

## Measurement Cadence
| Metric | Frequency | Method |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| NPS | Quarterly | Email survey |
| CSAT | Per interaction | In-app prompt |
| CES | Post-support | Follow-up survey |
| Usage | Continuous | Analytics |
```

### 3. Voice of Customer (VoC) Program

```markdown
# Voice of Customer Framework

## Collection Channels

### Solicited Feedback
- [ ] NPS/CSAT surveys
- [ ] User interviews
- [ ] Focus groups
- [ ] Beta feedback programs

### Unsolicited Feedback
- [ ] Support tickets (categorize and analyze)
- [ ] App store reviews
- [ ] Social mentions
- [ ] Community forums
- [ ] Sales call notes

## Analysis Framework

### Feedback Categorization
| Category | Example | Owner | Priority |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| Feature request | "I wish I could..." | Product | Backlog |
| Bug report | "This doesn't work..." | Engineering | Immediate |
| Confusion | "I don't understand..." | Design | High |
| Praise | "I love that..." | Marketing | Share |
| Churn risk | "Considering alternatives" | Success | Urgent |

### Insight Synthesis
1. **Cluster** similar feedback
2. **Quantify** frequency and impact
3. **Prioritize** by business value
4. **Action** with clear ownership
5. **Close loop** with customers
```

### 4. Service Blueprint

```markdown
# Service Blueprint: [Service Name]

## Layers

### Customer Actions (What customer does)
[Search] → [Compare] → [Sign up] → [Configure] → [Use] → [Get help]

### Frontstage (What customer sees)
Website → Signup flow → Dashboard → Support chat

### Backstage (Internal actions customer doesn't see)
Marketing analytics → CRM update → Account provisioning → Ticket routing

### Support Processes (Systems and tools)
Analytics platform → Salesforce → AWS → Zendesk

### Physical Evidence (Tangible artifacts)
Emails received, invoices, documentation

## Moments of Truth
1. **First impression:** Website load time, visual quality
2. **Commitment:** Signup completion, payment
3. **First value:** Feature that solves their problem
4. **Recovery:** How we handle mistakes

## Fail Points (Where things break)
| Point | Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Signup | Email not received | Abandonment | Retry mechanism, support escalation |
| Payment | Card declined | Lost sale | Multiple payment options, retry |
| Support | Long wait time | Frustration | SLA monitoring, overflow handling |
```
